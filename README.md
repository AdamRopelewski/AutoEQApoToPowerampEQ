# AutoEQApoToPowerampEQ

AutoEQApoToPowerampEQ is a tool designed to convert equalizer settings from the Apo Parametric format to a file importable by Android app: Poweramp EQ.

## How It Works

This tool takes an EQ configuration file in the txt format and converts it into a format compatible with Poweramp EQ. It automates the process, making it quick and easy for users to transfer their equalizer settings between these two formats.

## Usage

1. Put in the name of the eq (visible late in the Poweramp app)
2. Drag and drop txt file with eq exported from AutoEQ.app for EqualizerAPO ParametricEq
3. Specify the location and name of the .json file
4. Import the .json file into Poweramp Eq app
